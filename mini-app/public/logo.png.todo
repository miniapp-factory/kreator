512x512
A stylized 2048 game board with a 4x4 grid of tiles, each tile showing a number (2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) in a bold, contrasting font. The background is a subtle gradient from dark blue to light blue, giving a modern, digital feel. The tiles are rounded rectangles with a slight shadow, and the numbers are centered in white. The overall composition is clean and minimal, suitable for a web app logo.
